<h3>Research Experience</h3><br>

<h5>Research Assistant at CoLoRS Lab, Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey</h5>
<p>
Project: <strong>IMAGINE - Robots Understanding Their Actions by Imagining Their Effects</strong> , 2017 - ongoing  <br>
This project seeks to enable robots to understand the environment and objects it works with, and how 
they are affected by its actions. This objective is pursued in the context of recycling of electromechanic
alappliances.  Our responsibilities in this project are:

<ul>
<li>Identify the affordances provided in a scene, i.e. the set of actions that can currently be executed.</li>
<li>Determining action parameters for currently-admissible actions as selected by the planner.</li>
<li>Finding the possible effects of determined actions.</li>
</ul>
This project is funded by the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme.

<h5>Research Intern at CiNet, Osaka, Japan</h5>
<p>
Project: <strong>CREST "Cognitive Mirroring"</strong> , 14.01.2018 - 10.02.2018 <br>
In my internship, I worked with a Maximum Entropy Inverse Reinforcement Learning model and applied
it to infant imitation learning problem.
