<h3>About Me</h3>

<p>
    I am a PhD student at Department of Computer Engineering at Boğaziçi University, supervised by <a href="https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/~emre/">Emre Uğur</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Currently, I am a member of <a href="http://colors.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/">Cognition, Learning and Robotics (CoLoRs)</a> research group, Istanbul, 
    Turkey and working in EU funded Horizon 2020 project, <a href="https://www.imagine-h2020.eu/">Robots Understanding Their Actions by Imagining Their Effects (IMAGINE)</a>. 
    My current research is about enabling robots to understand its environment, and predict the consequences of its action on this environment. 
</p>

<p>
    My research interests lie in machine learning, and robotics. 
    In particular, I am interested in how we can use forward and inverse models of dynamics for decision making and control in robotics.
