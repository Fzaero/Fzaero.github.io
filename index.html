<h3>About Me</h3>

<p>
    I am a PhD student at the Department of Electrical Engineering at the Chalmers University of Technology, supervised by <a href="https://yaseminb.github.io/">Yasemin Bekiroğlu</a>.
</p>

<p>
    In my MSc, I was a research assistant at the Department of Computer Engineering at Boğaziçi University, supervised by
    <a href="https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/~emre/">Emre Uğur</a>, and I was one of the first members of 
    <a href="http://colors.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/">Cognition, Learning, and Robotics (CoLoRs)</a> research group, Istanbul, Turkey.
    I worked in EU funded Horizon 2020 project, <a href="https://www.imagine-h2020.eu/">Robots Understanding Their Actions by Imagining Their Effects (IMAGINE)</a>. 
    My research was about enabling robots to understand their environment, and predict the consequences of their action on this environment. 
</p>

<p>
    My research interests lie in representation learning and robotic manipulation. 
    In particular, I am interested in pursuing the research question of how an agent should interact with its 
    environment so that it can learn underlying structured models of the environment that can be used in various manipulation tasks.
